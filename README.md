## Hi there 👋 am Spiderssh 🕷️

💻 A learning pentester and definitely not a hacker! 😉

🚀 My playground mostly is in Python, Java, xml, and more tech wizardry, crafting cutting-edge solutions 💡

🔧 I thrive on solving problems and finding new vulnerabilities. Give me a challenge, and I’ll turn it into a success story!

🌟 Innovation, creativity, and resilience are the heart of my work—let’s shape the tech world together!
